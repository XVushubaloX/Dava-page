    <p><b>Sophie Brittain</b>, a freelance product designer in New York City, has a polished static website that showcases her work and makes it easy to get in touch.

        The site is super simple. We’re talking two pages, four colors, a couple mouseover effects, and less than 500 total words.
        
        But there’s nothing missing. 
        
        The focus of the site is her past work, which is captured in high quality images. There’s nothing inventive in the way it’s arranged, but it’s clear that she has completed demanding design projects for big brands.
        
        We take a real close look at the website of any freelancers we hire on Quick Sprout. Maybe we’ll take a peek at a resume (maybe), but we are 100% checking the website of any writer, designer, developer, or other contract role we need to fill.
        
        If you are a full-stack developer, a dynamic site is a great way to showcase your abilities. 
        
        For anyone else, complex page elements are probably going to take the focus away from your work.</p>
